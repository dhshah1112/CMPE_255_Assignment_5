# CMPE_255_Assignment_5

The task was to pick famous Kaggle datasets for each of the below mentioned categories(types): 

1) Tabular diverse set of data types like nyc taxi
2) Timeseries
3) Spatio-Temporal
4) Image(use kerascv or popular package)
5)  Audio
6) Video (action recognition)
7) Graph data set (pick any popular like citation etc.,.)

The goal of this assignment was to do EDA, data preparation and data pre-processing of popular kaggle data sets that need to be cleaned
For each of the above mentioned categories of datasets we needed to perform the below mentioned tasks: 

A) Do detailed data preprocssing cleaning and all the steps - before that do detailed eda - Take chat gpt4 help if needed. you can use auto eda and auto ds together with your manual insights and auto ml (like azure,sagemaker)
B) Do clustering and anomaly elimnations in the data sets. do data imputation etc.,. all steps in data preparation including feature processing and feature selection
C) Build various ml models using auto ml including ensemble model - 
D) Write medium paper of how you leveraged gpt4 code interpreter  for rapidly do these all steps for each of the exercises and your experiences
and at last submit the medium link for the same.

Task1:
I needed a tabular diverse set of data types so I chose the very famous movie lens dataset small. Then, I went ahead with all of the above mentioned steps to go on make a movie recommendation model that I felt worked decently. Colab link for it is: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11kfHi5LdgY1miAlqXRIvGohPJHukpLmo?usp=sharing. The medium article link which I published is: https://medium.com/@dhshah1112/navigating-data-science-with-gpt-4-a-deep-dive-into-advanced-data-preprocessing-and-modeling-of-a-4781b291d6ab

Task2: 
I needed a timeseries dataset so I searched around kaggle and found a dataset containing avacado prices and their dates. I performed all the steps and set up ML model for predicting avacado prices on new and unseen data.

Task3: 
I searched on kaggle for a spatio-temporal dataset and found one of the famous ones, NYC Taxi dataset. I performed all the steps and the link for colab file is : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16ujHBkH7xi2yWISiY4DPgr_sZEiSaXUH?usp=sharing.

Task4: 
I asked gpt4 for some sugestions on datasets for image and took one of the famous datasets, Fashion MNIST datasets. All the required tasks were performed and the colab file is : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QDtT2e5rRqFiaMzyoDu2B9D7GJy5TY2M?usp=sharing.

Task5: 
Audio dataset: AudioMNIST. Colab file : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iHitwJ7_B5h4fImhlMyEUbOmYhm8bhK7?usp=sharing. The medium link: https://medium.com/@dhshah1112/leveraging-gpt-4-for-rapid-data-preprocessing-analysis-and-modeling-in-audio-data-e235e7c9e71c.

Task6: 
Video Dataset: Action recognition dataset, KTH Dataset. Colab file: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BcYaXcR7riroBPdAbrkh9AC-YWGav3LM?usp=sharing
Medium article: https://medium.com/@dhshah1112/rapid-data-science-with-gpt-4-code-interpreter-for-video-dataset-c8e476565f91

Task7: 
Graph data set: I asked GPT4 for searching around some datasets but it could not find one so I asked it to generate a synthetic dataset and perform all the necessary steps.
